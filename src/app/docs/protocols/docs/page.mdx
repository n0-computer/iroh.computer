# Documents

A protocol for a mutable key-value store. Authors create and join documents, multiple users read from them, write to them, and sync with them, subscribing to live updates in real time. {{className: 'lead'}}

<div className='not-prose in-prose mb-5'>
  <ThemeImage
    lightSrc='/diagrams/documents.svg'
    darkSrc='/diagrams/documents_dark.svg'
    alt='a diagram of three author devices with arrows pointing to a document. the document is a table with key and value columns. for each row, the value column has an arrow pointing out to a blob'
    width={800}
    height={450}
  />
</div>

## Document Namespaces

A document is a _namespace_ that is uniquely identified by a keypair.

A key in a document is just a sequence of bytes. In practice keys are almost always [UTF-8 strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8). A value in a document is always a hash that points to a blob. Conceptually, a document looks like this when written in JSON notation:

```json
{
  "bar": "bafkr4iebxyldaiwztn5kwt6bap5e5bnzeru5lgc64w6lns644ir6ky5soi",
  "bananas": "bafkr4ihr5vpp33v5ufos2dneywofls3gx67b5jmraxcn77odsu3yqcsohq",
  "foo": "bafkr4ic3ywkoq5k2bn7kaiz6lovehgkpfqk4kwstepcbs7pw256dtxutme",
  "slashes/are/also/ok": "bafkr4ic3ywkoq5k2bn7kaiz6lovehgkpfqk4kwstepcbs7pw256dtxutme",
  "so.are.dots": "bafkr4ic3ywkoq5k2bn7kaiz6lovehgkpfqk4kwstepcbs7pw256dtxutme",
  // ...
}
```

An _entry_ in the document is a key-value pair. When an author writes an entry they first create a blob, then use the hash of the blob as the value, then pick a label to use as the key.

## Authors & Permissions

Authors are users who have write access to a document. Every author has a keypair that represents their identity. The public side of a keypair identifies the user & validates the edits they make to the document, the private side of the keypair is used to sign edits.

Read access to a document is granted by sharing the document public key. Write access to a document is granted by sharing the document private key.

## Document Identifiers

Documents are referred to within iroh-docs by their _document identifier_ or _DocID_. They look like this:

```text {{ title: "a document identifier" }}
ktrygcpxealfdtfmohw66nb2keivu52opk65cyj4j7jy7wior7ea
```

Document IDs are base32-lower serialization of the public key of the document. They do _not_ change as the document changes.

## Synchronizing Documents

When an author wants to sync with a document, they first find the document's current state, then they perform a [range-based set reconciliation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13567) to fill in any changes in the keyspace.

When two nodes want to sync, they perform a range-based set reconciliation to fill in any changes in the keyspace. Any node with the read key (document ID) can read & sync the latest state of the document. Having the read key denotes read access. All entries in the document are double-signed, once with an authorID (keypair) and the write key of the document.

<Note>
Check out our [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D_tbAMqADM) on how range-based set reconciliation works!
</Note>

After this synchronization step, we know the hashes of all the content the document references. By default iroh-docs documents will fetch all content associated with the document.

## Document PubSub

Every document is its own pubsub swarm, keyed by the public key of the document using iroh-gossip. These swarms implement techniques described in [HyParView](https://asc.di.fct.unl.pt/~jleitao/pdf/dsn07-leitao.pdf?ref=bartoszsypytkowski.com) & PlumTree to keep a bounded number of active nodes any one node in the swarm needs to push to.

<Note>
Bartosz Sypytkowski has a great [blog post](https://www.bartoszsypytkowski.com/hyparview/) on HyParView & Plumtree, well worth reading.
</Note>

As authors write to a document, they publish these changes as pubsub messages that other peers pick up on & apply to their local state.

## Storage

Iroh-docs can be used with in-memory or file-system based storage. The store is used to keep track of all relevant metadata necessary for management of documents, authors and keys. The contents associated to keys is managed by [`iroh-blobs`](/docs/layers/blobs), which stores data in a optimized, content-addressed manner. Data can be imported and exported out of iroh-docs's storage using [`doc import`](/docs/api/docs-import) and [`doc export`](/docs/api/docs-export).

## API

Documents can be manipulated and queried using the [docs API](/docs/api).

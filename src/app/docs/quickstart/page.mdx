# Quickstart

Let's dive into iroh by building a simple peer-to-peer file transfer tool in rust! {{ className: 'lead' }}


## What we'll build

At the end we should be able to transfer a file from one device by running this:

```sh
$ cargo run -- send ./file.txt
Indexing file.
File analyzed. Fetch this file by running:
cargo run -- receive blobabvojvy[...] file.txt
```

And then fetch it on any other device like so:
```sh
$ cargo run -- receive blobabvojvy[...] file.txt
Starting download.
Finished download.
Copying to destination.
Finished copying.
Shutting down.
```

In this guide we'll be omitting the import statements required to get this working.
If you're ever confused about what to import, take a look at the imports in the [complete example](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-blobs/blob/main/examples/transfer.rs).


## Get set up

We'll assume you've set up [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) on your machine.

Initialize a new project by running `cargo init file-transfer`, then `cd file-transfer` and install all the packages we're going to use: `cargo add iroh iroh-base tokio anyhow && cargo add iroh-blobs --features rpc`.

From here on we'll be working inside the `src/main.rs` file.


## Create an `iroh::Endpoint`

To start interacting with other iroh nodes, we need to build an `iroh::Endpoint`.
This is what manages the possibly changing network underneath, maintains a connection to the closest relay, and finds ways to address devices by `NodeId`.

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Create an endpoint, it allows creating and accepting
    // connections in the iroh p2p world
    let endpoint = Endpoint::builder().discovery_n0().bind().await?;

    // ...

    Ok(())
}
```

There we go, this is all we need to [open connections](https://docs.rs/iroh/latest/iroh/endpoint/struct.Endpoint.html#method.connect) or [accept them](https://docs.rs/iroh/latest/iroh/endpoint/struct.Endpoint.html#method.accept).

<Note>
Here, we're specifically configuring the `Endpoint`'s builder to include "number 0 discovery".
This makes it connect to DNS servers that [number 0](https://n0.computer) runs to find which relay to talk to for specific `NodeId`s.
It's a great default!
But if you want to, you can add other discovery types like [`discovery_local_network`](https://docs.rs/iroh/latest/iroh/endpoint/struct.Builder.html#method.discovery_local_network) based on mDNS, or [`discovery_dht`](https://docs.rs/iroh/latest/iroh/endpoint/struct.Builder.html#method.discovery_dht) for discovery based on the bittorrent mainline DHT.

If all of this is too much magic for your taste, it's possible for the endpoint to work entirely without any discovery services.
In that case, you'll need to make sure you're not only dialing by `NodeId`, but also help the `Endpoint` out with giving it the whole [`NodeAddr`](https://docs.rs/iroh/latest/iroh/struct.NodeAddr.html) when connecting.
</Note>


## Using an existing protocol: [iroh-blobs](/proto/iroh-blobs)

Instead of writing our own protocol from scratch, let's use iroh-blobs, which already does what we want:
It loads files from your file system and provides a protocol for seekable, resumable downloads of these files.

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Create an endpoint, it allows creating and accepting
    // connections in the iroh p2p world
    let endpoint = Endpoint::builder().discovery_n0().bind().await?;

    // We initialize the Blobs protocol in-memory
    let local_pool = LocalPool::default();
    let blobs = Blobs::memory().build(&local_pool, &endpoint);

    // ...

    Ok(())
}
```

<Note>
Learn more about what we mean by "protocol" on the [protocol documentation page](/docs/concepts/protocol).
</Note>

With these two lines, we've initialized iroh-blobs and gave it access to our `Endpoint`.

This is not quite enough to make it answer requests from the network, for that we need to configure a so-called `Router` for protocols.
Similar to routers in webserver libraries, it runs a loop accepting incoming connections and routes them to the specific handler.
However, instead of handlers being organized by HTTP paths, it routes based on "ALPNs".
Read more about ALPNs and the router on the [protocol](/docs/concepts/protocol#alpns) and [router](/docs/concepts/router) documentation pages.

Now, using the `Router` we can finish the skeleton of our application integrating iroh and iroh-blobs:

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Create an endpoint, it allows creating and accepting
    // connections in the iroh p2p world
    let endpoint = Endpoint::builder().discovery_n0().bind().await?;

    // We initialize the Blobs protocol in-memory
    let local_pool = LocalPool::default();
    let blobs = Blobs::memory().build(&local_pool, &endpoint);

    // Now we build a router that accepts blobs connections & routes them
    // to the blobs protocol.
    let router = Router::builder(endpoint)
        .accept(iroh_blobs::ALPN, blobs.clone())
        .spawn()
        .await?;

    // do *something*

    // Gracefully shut down the router
    println!("Shutting down.");
    router.shutdown().await?;
    local_pool.shutdown().await;

    Ok(())
}
```

I've also taken the liberty to make sure that we're gracefully shutting down the `Router` and all its protocols with it, as well as the `LocalPool` that the iroh-blobs library needs to operate.


## Doing something

So far, this code works, but doesn't actually do anything besides spinning up a node and immediately shutting down.
Even if we put in a `tokio::time::timeout` or `tokio::signal::ctrl_c().await` in there, it *would* actually respond to network requests for the blobs protocol, but even that is practically useless as we've stored no blobs to respond with.

Here's our plan for turning this into a CLI that actually does what we set out to build:
1. We'll grab a [`Blobs::client`](https://docs.rs/iroh-blobs/latest/iroh_blobs/net_protocol/struct.Blobs.html#method.client) to interact with the iroh-blobs node we're running locally.
2. We check the CLI arguments to find out whether you ran `cargo run -- send [PATH]` or `cargo run -- receive [TICKET] [PATH]`.
3. If we're supposed to send data:
  - we'll use [`add_from_path`](https://docs.rs/iroh-blobs/latest/iroh_blobs/rpc/client/blobs/struct.Client.html#method.add_from_path) to index local data and make it available,
  - print instructions for fetching said file,
  - and then wait for Ctrl+C.
4. If we're supposed to receive data:
  - we'll parse the ticket out of the CLI arguments,
  - download the file using [`download`](https://docs.rs/iroh-blobs/latest/iroh_blobs/rpc/client/blobs/struct.Client.html#method.download),
  - and copy the result the local file system.

Phew okay! Here's how we'll grab an iroh-blobs client and look at the CLI arguments:

```rust
let blobs = blobs.client();

let args = std::env::args().collect::<Vec<_>>();
match &args.iter().map(String::as_str).collect::<Vec<_>>()[..] {
    [_cmd, "send", path] => {
        todo!();
    }
    [_cmd, "receive", ticket, path] => {
        todo!();
    }
    _ => {
        println!("Couldn't parse command line arguments.");
        println!("Usage:");
        println!("    # to send:");
        println!("    cargo run --example transfer -- send [FILE]");
        println!("    # this will print a ticket.");
        println!();
        println!("    # to receive:");
        println!("    cargo run --example transfer -- receive [TICKET] [FILE]");
    }
}
```

Now all we need to do is fill in the `todo!()`s one-by-one:

### Getting ready to send

If we want to make a file available over the network with iroh-blobs, we first need to index this file.

<Note>
What does this step do?

It hashes the file using BLAKE3 and stores a so-called "outboard" for that file.
This outboard file contains information about hashes for parts of this file.
All of this enables some extra features with iroh-blobs like automatically verifying the integrity of the file *during* streaming, verified range downloads and download resumption.
</Note>

```rust
let abs_path = PathBuf::from_str(path)?.canonicalize()?;

println!("Indexing file.");

let blob = blobs
    .add_from_path(abs_path, true, SetTagOption::Auto, WrapOption::NoWrap)
    .await?
    .finish()
    .await?;
```

The `WrapOption::NoWrap` is just an indicator that we don't want to wrap the file with some metadata information about its file name.
We keep it simple here for now!

Now, we'll print a `BlobTicket`.
This ticket contains the `NodeId` of our `Endpoint` as well as the file's BLAKE3 hash.

```rust
let node_id = router.endpoint().node_id();
let ticket = BlobTicket::new(node_id.into(), blob.hash, blob.format)?;

println!("File analyzed. Fetch this file by running:");
println!("cargo run --example transfer -- receive {ticket} {path}");

tokio::signal::ctrl_c().await?;
```

And as you can see, as a final step we wait for the user to stop the file providing side by hitting `Ctrl+C` in the console.

### Connecting to the other side to receive

On the connection side, we got the `ticket` and the `path` from the CLI arguments and we can parse them into their `struct` versions.

With them parsed, we can call `blobs.download` with the information contained in the ticket and wait for the download to finish:

```rust
let path_buf = PathBuf::from_str(path)?;
let ticket = BlobTicket::from_str(ticket)?;

println!("Starting download.");

blobs
    .download(ticket.hash(), ticket.node_addr().clone())
    .await?
    .finish()
    .await?;

println!("Finished download.");
```

As a final step, we'll copy the file we just downloaded to the desired file path:

```rust
println!("Copying to destination.");

let mut file = tokio::fs::File::create(path_buf).await?;
let mut reader = blobs.read_at(ticket.hash(), 0, ReadAtLen::All).await?;
tokio::io::copy(&mut reader, &mut file).await?;

println!("Finished copying.");
```

<Note>
This first download the file completely into memory, then copy that memory into a file in two steps.

There's ways to make this work without having to store the whole file in memory, but that involves setting up `Blobs::persistent` instead of `Blobs::memory` and using `blobs.export` with `EntryMode::TryReference`.
We'll leave these changes as an exercise to the reader 😉
</Note>

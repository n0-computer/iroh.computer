# Installation

Install the Iroh Command Line Interface (CLI) for MacOS, Linux & Windows. {{className: 'lead'}}


<Note>
Iroh is meant be used as a library by importing one of the existing Iroh SDKs, but the CLI provides a great tool for working with iroh, and is a great way to use iroh if your language doesn't have a supported SDK.

## Removing Iroh
To completely remove iroh from your system, remove the binary executable and delete the _data directory_.

By default the iroh CLI persists to a data directory that keeps configuration & a small database. The location of that directory is platform specific:

| Platform | Value                                 | Example                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Linux    | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `$HOME`/.config/iroh | /home/alice/.config/iroh              |
| macOS    | `$HOME`/Library/Application Support/iroh   | /Users/Alice/Library/Application Support/iroh |
| Windows  | `{FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}`/iroh           | C:\Users\Alice\AppData\Roaming\iroh   |

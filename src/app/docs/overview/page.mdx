# Overview

Iroh is a protocol for scaling byte distribution. Here's a high level description of how that works {{className: 'lead'}}

Any app that includes the iroh library an iroh _node_. Iroh is designed to work in lots of places, including phones, tablets, desktop devices, and web servers.

A node provides a database to the user, and can connect to any other node on the network to fetch and send data to populate the database. Because nodes can connect directly to each other iroh networks can reach massive sizes without over-burdening any one node.

The database is made up of _documents_, a set of key-value entries.

Every iroh network has an _anchor_, a node that functions like a traditional web server to support the network. They help peers find each other and back up content to keep it available when peers go offline. Anchor nodes can be created with one click.

In the tech industry we talk a lot about scaling, but have a very funny 

The solution using cloud technologies alone is to throw more (cloud) computing at the problem.

Numerous bandwidth-intensive applications have hit these scaling limitations

Iroh takes this 

Iroh peers create and join *documents:* mutable key-value stores that multiple users read from, write to, and sync with, subscribing to live updates in real time.

Every key in a document points to a hash-verified blob of bytes. We say “blobs” because Iroh doesn’t care about what bytes you need moved, the structure is up to you. Document blobs can be thousands of tiny JSON files, gig-sized movies, or multi-gig machine learning models. Every blob gets a single CID that peers fetch via relay-backed connections that will automatically resume if broken.

# Layers

Iroh is organized into three _layers_. Each higher layer depends on functionality in the layer below it. Documents rely on blobs, and blobs rely on connections.

<Concepts>
  <Concept name="Documents" href="/docs/layers/documents" description="Collaborate on shared key-value tables of blobs with peers." />
  <Concept name="Blobs" href="/docs/layers/blobs" description="Fetch and cache byte sequences by their hash." />
  <Concept name="Connections" href="/docs/layers/connections" description="Open a connection to any available peer on the network." />
</Concepts>

Most users can and should be able to build entire applications with only the sync layer. If your use case is complex, iroh lets you remove the batteries, dropping down to lower layers in the stack. You can build trustless systems directly on the blob layer, or build your own networking protocol using the connection layer.

<Note>
We're focused on stabilizing iroh starting with the sync layer, and working our way down.
The lower you go, the more prepared you should be for API changes.
</Note>

As an example, you may be building a standalone chat app. The messages and all attachments in a chat can be stored in a document. Iroh could handle syncing & caching all messages & attachments for you at the document layer, and you could extend a "user is typing" protocol directly on the connection layer.

## Documents

Iroh peers create and join _documents_: mutable key-value stores that multiple users read from, write to, and sync with, subscribing to live updates in real time.

It's important to note that the sync layer of iroh is _trusted_. Your app will need need a mechanism for identifying which peers should be allowed to edit a document. Granting a peer edit access to a document

Each key in a values in document points to a blob, which iroh creates for you when you write to the document. Whenever mutate a document, iroh pushes updates to all subcribed peers via the connection layer.

## Blobs

Every key in a document points to a hash-verified blob of bytes. We say “blobs” because Iroh doesn\'t care about what bytes you need moved, the structure is up to you. Document blobs can be thousands of tiny JSON files, gig-sized movies, or multi-gig machine learning models. Every blob gets a single hash that peers fetch, using the connections layer.

The blob layer is the first "trustless" layer of iroh, you don't need to know the user you're getting content from to verify it is the content you asked for, that's what the hash is for 😁

## Connections

At the core of iroh is the ability to establish a QUIC connection to any peer that is online.

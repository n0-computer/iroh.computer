# 1. Endpoints

The journey of a connection starts with an endpoint. An endpoint is one of the two termination points for a connection. It’s one of the tin cans that the wire is connected to. Because this is peer-2-peer, endpoints both _initiate_ *and* _accept_ connections. The endpoint handles both.

Let's first add iroh to our project. From the project root run `cargo add iroh` to install the latest version:

```bash
$ cargo add iroh
    Updating crates.io index
      Adding iroh v0.32.1 to dependencies
             Features:
             + metrics
             - discovery-pkarr-dht
             - discovery-local-network
             - examples
             - test-utils
    Updating crates.io index
     Locking 432 packages to latest compatible versions
```

We're also going to need a few supporting libraries so let's add those as well:

```bash
cargo add tokio anyhow rand
```

In the end your `Cargo.toml` file's `[dependencies]` section should look something like this. It's ok if the version numbers are slightly different:

```toml
[dependencies]
anyhow = "1.0.95"
iroh = "0.32.1"
rand = "0.8.5"
tokio = "1.43.0"
```

## Starting an Endpoint

With our dependencies added, open up `src/main.rs` and add the following code:

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Create an endpoint
    let builder = iroh::Endpoint::builder();

    // bind it to a socket
    let endpoint = builder.bind().await?;

    // print this endpoint's node id
    println!("node id: {:?}", endpoint.node_id());

    // exit the program
    Ok(())
}
```


Then save and run your program with `cargo run`. You should see output similar to this:

```bash
b5 at number-0 in ~/code/iroh-tour (main●)
$ cargo run
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.80s
     Running `/Users/b5/.cargo/build/debug/iroh-tour`
node id: PublicKey(95224c92856163add8a9cb68a81183aa5d9881c4def58625a9f4266a0743b479)
```

<Note>
  This code just prints its ID & exits. For a more complete example, check out the [connect example](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/blob/main/iroh/examples/connect.rs)
</Note>

The non-setup part of this program adds up to 3 lines of code, and one of them is a print statement! The first line constructs an endpoint. 99% of apps will have a single endpoint in the entire app, so you’ll build the endpoint once, and refer to it a bunch. Then we call *bind* to ask the operating system for a networking port. This calling bind will kick off work in the background that we’ll talk about in a bit.

Those three lines are the beating heart of adding iroh to an app. Once the node ID prints we have an active endpoint that's ready to connect & (if configured to) accept connections. Everything else builds up from here.

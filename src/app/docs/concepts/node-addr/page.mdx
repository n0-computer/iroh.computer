# Node Addresses

Node Addresses or [`NodeAddrs`](https://docs.rs/iroh/latest/iroh/struct.NodeAddr.htm) are a common struct you'll interact when working with iroh to tell iroh what & where to dial. In rust they look like this:

```rust
pub struct NodeAddr {
    pub node_id: PublicKey,
    pub relay_url: Option<RelayUrl>,
    pub direct_addresses: BTreeSet<SocketAddr>,
}
```

You'll interact with `NodeAddr`s a fair amount when working with iroh. Discovery Services like `local_discovery` will emit a stream of `NodeAddrs` that it finds on the local network. It's also quite normal to construct addresses manually from, say, node identifiers stored in your application database.

When we call [`connect`](https://docs.rs/iroh/latest/iroh/endpoint/struct.Endpoint.html#method.connect) on an [Endpoint](http://localhost:3000/docs/concepts/endpoint), we need to pass either a `NodeAddr`, or something that can turn into a `NodeAddr`. In iroh `NodeAddr`s will have different fields populated depending on where they came from, and the discovery services you've configured your node with.

### Interaction with discovery
From the above struct, the only _required_ field is the node_id. And because of this, there's an implementation of `From` that can turn `NodeIDs` directly into NodeAddrs. _but this will only work if you have a discovery service that can resolve NodeIDs enabled_. So generally if you want to use raw NodeIDs, you'll need something that looks like this when you set up your endpoint:

```rust
use iroh::Endpoint;

let ep = Endpoint::builder()
    // this part enables dialing by NodeAddrs that only have NodeIDs:
    .discovery_n0()
    .bind()
    .await?;
```

This is why we actively encourage configuring a discovery service, and DNS is the most common one we recommend. Because we're in p2p land dialing details & even home relays for a node can change on very short notice, making this data go stale quickly. Node Identifiers are a practical source of stability that counteracts this.

### When to provide full details
If you have full dialing details, it's well worth providing them as part of a `NodeAddr` passed to `connect`. Iroh can use this to skip the network roundtrip required to either do initial address discovery, or update cached addresses. So if you have a source of up to date home relay & dialing info, provide it!

### Don't store relay_url & direct_addresses values
If you're persisting the contents of `NodeAddr` in your app, it's probably not worth keeping the `relay_url` and `direct_address` fields, unless you _know_ these details are unlikely to change. Providing stale details to the endpoint can slow down connection construction.

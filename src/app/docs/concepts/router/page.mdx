# Router

To make composing protocols easier, iroh includes a _router_ for composing together multiple protocols. {{className: 'lead'}}

The router implements the [accept loop](/docs/concepts/protocol#the-accept-loop) on your behalf, and routes incoming connections to the correct protocol based on the [ALPN](/docs/concepts/protocol#alpns). We recommend using the router to compose protocols, as it makes it easier to add new protocols to your application.

We use the term _router_ because it mimics what an HTTP server would do with an URL-based router.

```rust
use anyhow::Result;
use iroh::protocol::Router;
use iroh::Endpoint;
use iroh_blobs::{store::mem::MemStore,BlobsProtocol};


#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Build an endpoint, defaulting to the public n0 relay network
    let endpoint = Endpoint::bind().await?;

    // We initialize an in-memory backing store for iroh-blobs
    let store = MemStore::new();
    
    // Then we initialize a struct that can accept blobs requests over iroh connections
    let blobs = BlobsProtocol::new(&store, None);

    // Build our router and add the blobs protocol, 
    // identified by its ALPN. Spawn the router to start listening.
    let router = Router::builder(endpoint)
        .accept(iroh_blobs::ALPN, blobs)
        .spawn();

    // get our own address. At this point we have a running router 
    // that's ready to accept connections.
    let addr = router.endpoint().addr();

    // Wait for exit
    tokio::signal::ctrl_c().await?;

    // Gracefully close the endpoint & protocols.
    // This makes sure that remote endpoints are notified about possibly still open connections
    // and any data is written to disk fully (or any other shutdown procedure for protocols).
    router.shutdown().await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

You can add whatever protocols you need to the router, multiplexing them all over the same endpoint.

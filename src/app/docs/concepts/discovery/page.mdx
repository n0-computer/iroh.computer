# Discovery

Discovery is the glue that connects a [Node Identifier](/docs/concepts/endpoint#node-identifiers) to something we can dial. Discovery services resolve NodeIds to either a home Relay URL or direct-dialing information. {{className: 'lead'}}

Node discovery is an automated system for an [Endpoint](/docs/concepts/endpoint) to retrieve addressing information. Each iroh node will automatically publish their own addressing information with configured discovery services. Usually this means publishing which [Home Relay](/docs/concepts/relay#home-relay) a node is findable at, but they could also publish their direct addresses.

## Discovery Services

There are four different implementations of the discovery service in iroh, all of which map NodeIds to addresses:

| | Discovery Implementation | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [DNS](#dns-discovery) | uses a custom Domain Name System server |
| 2 | [Local](#local-discovery) | uses an mDNS-like system to find nodes on the local network |
| 3 |  [Pkarr](#pkarr-discovery) | uses Pkarr Servers over HTTP |
| 4 | [DHT](#dht-discovery) | uses the BitTorrent Mainline DHT |

By Default, iroh uses the DNS discovery system to resolve NodeIds to addresses. And can be configured to use any of the other discovery systems.

## DNS Discovery
DNS performs node lookups via the standard DNS systems. To publish to this DNS server a PkarrPublisher is needed. Number 0 runs a public instance of the DNS discovery system

<Note>
    DNS Discovery has has it's own [blog post](/blog/iroh-dns)!

## Local Discovery
Local discovery adds the ability to scan local networks for other iroh nodes, using Local Swarm Discovery. This is useful for local networks, or for bootstrapping a network before a relay is available.

Local Discovery is _not_ enabled by default, and must be enabled by the user. You'll need to add the `discovery-local-network` feature flag to your `Cargo.toml` to use it.

```toml
[dependencies]
iroh = { version = "0.1", features = ["discovery-local-network"] }
```

Then configure your endpoint to use local discovery concurrently with DNS discovery:

```rust
use iroh::{
    discovery::{dns::DnsDiscovery, LocalSwarmDiscovery, pkarr::PkarrPublisher, ConcurrentDiscovery},
    Endpoint, SecretKey,
};

let secret_key = SecretKey::generate(rand::rngs::OsRng);
let discovery = ConcurrentDiscovery::from_services(vec![
    Box::new(DnsDiscovery::n0_dns()),
    Box::new(LocalSwarmDiscovery::new(secret_key.public())?),
]);

let ep = Endpoint::builder()
    .secret_key(secret_key)
    .discovery(Box::new(discovery))
    .bind()
    .await?;
```

## Pkarr Discovery
The Pkarr resolver can perform lookups from designated [pkarr relay servers](https://github.com/Pubky/pkarr#servers) using HTTP. Read more about the pkarr project [here](https://github.com/Pubky/pkarr?tab=readme-ov-file#pkarr).

## DHT Discovery
DHT discovery uses the [BitTorrent Mainline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainline_DHT) distributed hash table (DHT) to publish & resolve NodeIds.

DHT Discovery is _not_ enabled by default, and must be enabled by the user. You'll need to add the `discovery-pkarr-dht` feature flag to your `Cargo.toml` to use it.

```toml
[dependencies]
# Make sure to use the most recent version here instead of nn.
iroh = { version = "0.nn", features = ["discovery-pkarr-dht"] }
```

Then configure your endpoint to use DHT discovery concurrently with DNS discovery:

```rust
use iroh::{
    discovery::{dns::DnsDiscovery, pkarr::dht::DhtDiscovery, ConcurrentDiscovery},
    Endpoint, SecretKey,
};

let secret_key = SecretKey::generate(rand::rngs::OsRng);
let discovery = ConcurrentDiscovery::from_services(vec![
    Box::new(DnsDiscovery::n0_dns()),
    Box::new(DhtDiscvoery::new(secret_key.public())?),
]);

let ep = Endpoint::builder()
    .secret_key(secret_key)
    .discovery(Box::new(discovery))
    .bind()
    .await?;
```

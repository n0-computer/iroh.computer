# Discovery

Discovery is the glue that connects a [Endpoint Identifier](/docs/concepts/endpoint#endpoint-identifiers) to something we can dial. Discovery services resolve EndpointIds to either a home Relay URL or direct-dialing information. {{className: 'lead'}}

Endpoint discovery is an automated system for an [Endpoint](/docs/concepts/endpoint) to retrieve addressing information. Each iroh endpoint will automatically publish their own addressing information with configured discovery services. Usually this means publishing which [Home Relay](/docs/concepts/relay#home-relay) an endpoint is findable at, but they could also publish their direct addresses.

## Discovery Services

There are four different implementations of the discovery service in iroh, all of which map EndpointIds to addresses:

| | Discovery Implementation | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [DNS](#dns-discovery) | uses a custom Domain Name System server |
| 2 | [Local](#local-discovery) | uses an mDNS-like system to find endpoints on the local network |
| 3 | [Pkarr](#pkarr-discovery) | uses Pkarr Servers over HTTP |
| 4 | [DHT](#dht-discovery) | uses the BitTorrent Mainline DHT |

By Default, iroh uses the DNS discovery system to resolve EndpointIds to addresses. And can be configured to use any of the other discovery systems.

## DNS Discovery
DNS performs endpoint lookups via the standard DNS systems. To publish to this DNS server a PkarrPublisher is needed. Number 0 runs a public instance of the DNS discovery system

<Note>
    DNS Discovery has its own [blog post](/blog/iroh-dns)!

## Local Discovery
Local discovery adds the ability to scan local networks for other iroh endpoints, using Local Swarm Discovery. This is useful for local networks, or for bootstrapping a network before a relay is available.

Local Discovery is _not_ enabled by default, and must be enabled by the user. You'll need to add the `discovery-local-network` feature flag to your `Cargo.toml` to use it.

```toml
[dependencies]
# Make sure to use the most recent version here instead of nn. (at the time of writing: 0.32)
iroh = { version = "0.nn", features = ["discovery-local-network"] }
```

Then configure your endpoint to use local discovery concurrently with the default DNS discovery:

```rust
use iroh::Endpoint;

let mdns = iroh::discovery::mdns::MdnsDiscovery::builder();
let ep = Endpoint::builder()
    .discovery(mdns)
    .bind()
    .await?;
```

## Pkarr Discovery
The Pkarr resolver can perform lookups from designated [pkarr relay servers](https://github.com/Pubky/pkarr#servers) using HTTP. Read more about the pkarr project [here](https://github.com/Pubky/pkarr?tab=readme-ov-file#pkarr).

## DHT Discovery
DHT discovery uses the [BitTorrent Mainline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainline_DHT) distributed hash table (DHT) to publish & resolve EndpointIds.

DHT Discovery is _not_ enabled by default, and must be enabled by the user. You'll need to add the `discovery-pkarr-dht` feature flag to your `Cargo.toml` to use it.

```toml
[dependencies]
# Make sure to use the most recent version here instead of nn. (at the time of writing: 0.32)
iroh = { version = "0.nn", features = ["discovery-pkarr-dht"] }
```

Then configure your endpoint to use DHT discovery concurrently with DNS discovery:

```rust
use iroh::Endpoint;

let dht_discovery = iroh::discovery::dht::DhtDiscovery::builder();
let mdns = iroh::discovery::mdns::MdnsDiscovery::builder();
let ep = Endpoint::builder()
    .discovery(dnt_discovery)
    .discovery(mdns)
    .bind()
    .await?;
```

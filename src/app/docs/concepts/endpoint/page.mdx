# Endpoints

An _endpoint_ is the main API interface to create connections to, and accept connections from other iroh endpoints. The connections are peer-to-peer and encrypted, a [Relay](/docs/concepts/relay) server is used to make the connections reliable. Endpoints have a `EndpointID` (the public half of an Ed25519 keypair) and the private key used to sign and decrypt messages.

Generally, an application will have a single endpoint instance. This ensures all the connections made share the same peer-to-peer connections to other iroh endpoints, while still remaining independent connections. This will result in more optimal network behaviour.

Somewhere in a program that uses iroh for direct connections, you'll see code like this:

```rust
use iroh::Endpoint;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let endpoint = Endpoint::builder().bind().await.unwrap();
    // ...
}
```

Breaking that down the `builder` sets up configuration for the endpoint, and `bind` creates the endpoint and starts listening for incoming connections. The `await` keyword is used to wait for the endpoint to be created in an asynchronous context.

Once you have an endpoint, you can use it to create connections to other endpoints, or accept incoming connections from other endpoints.

## Endpoint Identifiers

Each endpoint in iroh has a unique identifier (`EndpointID`) created as a cryptographic key. This can be used to globally identify an endpoint. Because `EndpointIDs` are cryptographic keys, they are also the mechanism by which all traffic is always encrypted for a specific endpoint only.

See the [EndpointID](https://docs.rs/iroh/latest/iroh/type.EndpointId.html) documentation for more info.

## Connections

Because we're in a peer-2-peer context, either endpoint might be operating as the "server", so we use `connect` and `accept` to distinguish between the two. The `connect` method is used to create a new connection to a remote endpoint, while `accept` is used to accept incoming connections from a remote endpoint.

Connections are full-fledged QUIC connections, giving you access to most features of QUIC / HTTP3, including bidirectional and unidirectional streams.

<Note>
Due to the light-weight properties of QUIC streams a stream can only be accepted once the initiating peer has sent some data on it.

## Building on Endpoints

Endpoints are a low-level primitive that iroh exposes on purpose. For some projects like [dumbpipe](https://dumbpipe.dev), endpoints are 95% of what you need to connect any two devices on the planet. For others, like [iroh-blobs](/proto/iroh-blobs), endpoints are the foundation that higher-level protocols are built on. Most projects will not work with endpoints beyond constructing one and feeding it to one or more [protocols](/docs/concepts/protocol).

Welcome to a new release of iroh, the open-source distributed systems toolkit with tools for direct connections, moving data, and syncing state.

This time around a lot of work went into fixing subtle bugs, improving documentation, and polishing APIs. We hope this will help you enjoy iroh even more!

## 👾 Iroh vs Tokio

The `tokio_util` `LocalPoolHandle` does not properly handle `Drop` during shutdown. Its threads are just spawned as detached. So any `Drop` implementation that runs in a local pool thread will be stopped as soon as the process terminates.

This in turn can have some serious consequences if the `Drop` operation performs IO, like closing files and committing database transactions.

In order to fix this, we now have our own implementation of a `LocalPool`, which  more gracefully handles shutdown. The only thing you should notice about this, is that things are more stable.

For details check out [PR 2517](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/2517)

## 🐳 Docker Round 2

Our docker images are now published to docker hub, and tested in CI. Check them out at

- https://hub.docker.com/r/n0computer/iroh
- https://hub.docker.com/r/n0computer/iroh-relay
- https://hub.docker.com/r/n0computer/iroh-dns-server

For details checkout [PR 2520](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/2520)

## 🎯 Realigning APIs

Based on the Rust API, we have updated both the CLI and the FFI APIs, to make them as similar as possible.

For example, listing all blobs, looks like this now

```rust
// Rust
let blobs = iroh.blobs().list().await?;
```

```python
# Python
blobs = await iroh.blobs().list()
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin
val blobs = iroh.blobs().list()
```

```swift
// Swift
let blobs = try await iroh.blobs().list()
```

```python
# CLI
iroh blobs list blobs
```

For details checkout [iroh-ffi PR 167](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-ffi/pull/167) and [PR 2522](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/2522).

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### Protocol Changes

- iroh-relay
    - Clients will dial `/relay` instead of `/derp`, this means all `0.21` nodes are only compatible with relays `>= 0.20`

### API Changes

- `iroh-cli`
    - top level commands
        - `author` -> `authors`
        - `blob` -> `blobs`
        - `doc` -> `docs`
        - `tag` -> `tags`
        - sub commands
            - `new` -> `create`
    - added `metrics_dump_path` on the top level CLI parameters, which if set will make sure metrics are collected at regular intervals and written to the provided path in CSV format.
- `iroh`
    - removed deprecated
        - `client::MemIroh` use `iroh::client::Iroh` instead
        - `client::QuicIroh` use `iroh::client::Iroh` instead
        - `client::MemDoc`use `iroh::client::docs::Doc` instead
        - `client::QuicDoc` use `iroh::client::docs::Doc` instead
    -
- `iroh-net`
    - renamed
        - field: `magicsock::metrics::Metrics::update_endpoints` -> `update_direct_addrs`.
    - relay server is now behind the `iroh-relay` feature flag
    - removed
        - `endpoint::Builder::peers_path`
    - added
        - `endpoint::Builder::known_nodes`
- no automatic storage of known peers anymore in `iroh-net`
- Public interfaces using `tokio_util::task::LocalPoolHandle` now use our own `LocalPool`/`LocalPoolHandle`.

### But wait, there's more!

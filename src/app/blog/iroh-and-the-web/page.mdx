Iroh should work in as many environments as possible. This is one of the many reasons it's built in rust!
Today we have SDKs in rust, python, and swift via [`iroh-ffi`](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-ffi/) and run tests to ensure iroh compiles and runs on Ubuntu, MacOS, Windows, Android and even some BSDs!
And now we're excited to tackle the next environment: the browser.

## Challenges

Let's be honest: The browser is a harsh environment for all the new network protocols out there.
Iroh's networking stack - defined in our `iroh-net` crate - depends on QUIC, which will open a raw UDP socket on the lowest level. This is impossible in the browser.
That said, there's a native QUIC implementation coming to the browser in the form of WebTransport, hurray!
But wait, it doesn't quite work, because what you're connecting to needs to be served over DNS and have a working TLS certificate, whomp whooomp.
If you want to talk to another machine from your browser, you're pretty much stuck talking to servers only.
You can't just do an HTTP request from your laptop to your phone.

Don't get us wrong - we're big fans of encrypting everything!
That's why iroh connections are mutually authenticated and encrypted. But the TLS restrictions keep web applications from innovating beyond the server-client model.
However, we believe we can keep encrypting everything while making `iroh-net`, our networking crate - and later iroh itself - work in browsers out of the box!

## Our Opportunity

Some of you keen network enthusiasts out there may be saying: Wait! Direct connections between machines are hard even outside browsers: NATs and firewalls are getting in your way, too.
It seems like it's not only the browser that assumes a client-server model!
That's why we've already had a fallback in place: relay servers.
We've written about them before. In a nutshell, relay servers are publicly reachable servers equipped with a stable, public IP address, a DNS name, and TLS certificates.
They serve two main functions:
1. They help relay traffic that can't find its way directly from peer to peer.
2. They assist peers in discovering each other's IP addresses, potentially enabling direct connections.
Importantly, all of this happens without the relay servers being able to read your traffic - it's all encrypted.
By the way - if you have an application using iroh, you too can help nodes establish p2p connections by running your own relay (it's all open source)!

Anyway, these relays are a great opportunity for enabling connectivity for browser nodes.
Right now, the protocol they use is a custom HTTP upgrade protocol that can't be established from a browser.
In the coming weeks this is going to change.

## The Roadmap for iroh on the Web

### Phase 0: Relay Connections via Websockets

Our first course of action is supporting relay connections via Websockets.
Websockets are [widely supported](https://caniuse.com/?search=websockets) in browsers today.
This work has already started and is [almost finished](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/2387).
(It may already be done by the time you read this!)

### Phase 1: Compiling `iroh-net` to WebAssembly

This will be a bigger fish to fry. But it's tasty!
It mainly means going through the code and disabling code paths that use `UdpSocket` and similar things using `#[cfg(not(target_family = "wasm"))]`, as well as writing alternative code paths that use [web APIs to e.g. open websockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket).
After this major milestone, you'll already be able to talk to native nodes from your browser!
Many applications currently depend only on `iroh-net`, and we're excited to see what these projects will use their new browser capabilities for.
Crucially, we want you to be able to use `iroh-net` in the browser just as easily as you would use `iroh-net` natively.
Just plug it in and `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`, perhaps enable another feature, and it should work.

### Phase 2: All of iroh. In the browser.

`iroh-net` is a key piece of the iroh stack - but there are a lot of other features in iroh!
There's iroh gossip, iroh documents, and iroh blobs. (Read [our docs](https://iroh.computer/docs) to find out more!)
We believe all of these pieces together provide an amazing toolkit for building applications that enhance user agency.
That's why we're planning to bring them to the browser, too!
In this phase, we'll give our other crates the same treatment as we gave `iroh-net`:
Make sure all dependencies compile to WebAssembly and browser nodes can participate in iroh documents, just like any native node can.

### Phase 3: Beyond WebSockets

Some of you browser networking nerds out there have been screaming at us: "Lies, all lies! WebRTC exists! Peer to peer on the web is a reality!"
And yes. You're not wrong.
It's a somewhat little known fact that video conferencing brought peer to peer connections to browsers.
Because of low-latency requirements, real time communication is often transmitted peer to peer.
So when the WebRTC APIs were brought to the browser - they brought p2p with them.
We can leverage the WebRTC data channel APIs to send packets directly.
That said, this will mean equipping native iroh clients with WebRTC stacks, and those are *heavy*.
We'll see what we can do once we get here. Perhaps by then WebTransport will be extended to support direct connections?

## Conclusion

In the medium term, we want you to be able to use `iroh-net` in the browser just like you use it in other environments, as soon as possible.
No need to import another crate. Just `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` and `wasm-bindgen`.

In the long term, watch out for when the whole iroh API lands and you'll be able to use iroh documents and blobs directly in your browser.

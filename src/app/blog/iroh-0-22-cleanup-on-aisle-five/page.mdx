Welcome to a new release of iroh, the open-source distributed systems toolkit with tools for direct connections, moving data, and syncing state.

In `v0.22`, we‚Äôve focused on fixing bugs and adding stability.

## üèûÔ∏è Improved Handling of Existing Local Content

We've untangled a few subtle interactions in the downloader in this release. These interactions involved attempting to download content that you already had and attempting to download content from yourself.

Previously, if you tried to download a blob that you already had locally, the blob downloader would first attempt to open connections to peers *before* checking if you already had this blob locally. That process is now reversed: we check if you have a blob or collection locally before attempting to download it.

The second, more insidious, bug happened when your own `NodeId` was listed as a potential provider of the content you were trying to download. Now, if your own `NodeId` is the only listed provider, the download will fail with the ‚ÄúNo Providers‚Äù error.

For more information, checkout PR [#2586](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/2586).

## üöä Fix regression: Fast direct connections

In iroh, we relate many different addresses to one `NodeId` and we send data over the lowest latency path to that `NodeId`.

Previously, however, we would wait until we knew the latency of a node's direct address before we attempted to send to that address. In many scenarios, specifically the ones where we would need to hole-punch before being able to connect directly anyway, waiting for the `Ping`/`Pong` process to determine the latency was fine.

However, there are real scenarios where you already know the public direct address of the node you want to talk to. In this case, the connection should be instant since you know that no hole-punching is needed to establish a direct connection.

The changes in this release make that possible. If you know that a node has a direct, public address, when you supply that address using a `NodeAddr`, iroh will now immediately attempt to connect to that address.

For more information, checkout PR [#2580](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/2580).

## üîÅ More Robust Gossip Dispatcher

We‚Äôve made some changes in `iroh-gossip` to ensure we close and clean up connections safely and reliably.

The `net::Gossip` struct now tracks the client-side subscribers per topic. The topic will quit once all the handles to a `GossipTopic` are dropped.

This change completely removes the `iroh_gossip::dispatcher` and pulls most of those APIs into the `GossipTopic`. These APIs are not yet stable and may undergo another round of changes as we work with `iroh_gossip` more.

See below for the specific adjustments that need to be made to upgrade `iroh-gossip`.

Check out PR [#2570](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/2570) for more details.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

### Protocol Changes

### API Changes

- `iroh-gossip`
    - `iroh_gossip::dispatcher` is removed with everything that was in it. Use the new API from `iroh_gossip::net::Gossip` instead (see below).
    - `iroh_gossip::net::Gossip` methods changed:
        - changed: `join` now returns a `GossipTopic`
        - removed: `broadcast`, `broadcast_neighbors`, `subscribe`, `subscribe_all`, `quit`.
            - for `subscribe` use `join` instead, which returns a `GossipTopic`
            - for `broadcast` and `broadcast_neighbors` use the respective methods on `GossipTopic` .
            - `quit` is obsolete now, the topic will be quitted once all `GossipTopic` handles are dropped.
            - `subscribe_all` is no longer available
    - `iroh_gossip::net::JoinTopicFut` is removed (it is now obsolete)
- `iroh-net`
    - Refactored the module structure for users of the `iroh-relay` feature in iroh-net
        - moved
            - `iroh_net::relay::iroh_relay::*` to `iroh_net::relay::server::*`
            - `iroh_net::relay::ClientConnHandler` to `iroh_net::relay::server::ClientConnHandler`
            - `iroh_net::relay::Metrics` to `iroh_net::relay::server::Metrics`
            - `iroh_net::relay::MaybeTlsStreamServer` to `iroh_net::relay::server::MaybeTlsStreamServer`
            - `iroh_net::relay::http::Client` to `iroh_net::relay::HttpClient`
            - `iroh_net::relay::http::ClientBuilder` to `iroh_net::relay::HttpClientBuilder`
            - `iroh_net::relay::http::ClientReceiver` to `iroh_net::relay::HttpClientReceiver`
            - `iroh_net::relay::http::ClientError` to `iroh_net::relay::HttpClientError`
            - `iroh_net::relay::http::TlsConfig` to `iroh_net::relay::server::TlsConfig`
        - removed `iroh_net::relay::http::ServerHandle`. The server can now be aborted via its `task_handle()` function or by dropping it.
        - renamed `iroh_net::relay::RelayClient` to `iroh_net::relay::RelayConn`
        - renamed and moved `iroh_net::relay::Server` to `iroh_net::relay::server::ServerActorTask`
        - unexposed `iroh_net::relay::http::{Server, ServerBuilder}`. Use `iroh_net::relay::server::Server` instead.
    - Properly feature-gate the iroh server implementation behind `#[cfg(feature = "iroh-relay")]` by feature-gating the whole `iroh_net::relay::server` module.
- `iroh`
    - Unknown fields in the configuration file will now cause an error.
    - Configuring the GC Policy in the configuration file has changed.
        - Example:

    ```toml
    [gc_policy]
    enabled = true
    interval = 1234
    ```

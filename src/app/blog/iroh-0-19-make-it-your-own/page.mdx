Welcome to a new release of iroh, the open-source distributed systems toolkit with tools for connecting devices directly, moving data, and syncing state.

This release is all about making iroh more customizable for your own particular use case!

### Better late than never 😂
Iroh has commited to a two week release cadence, which, if you've been following along closely, we didn't hit this week! On Monday, our normal release day, we found a critical bug. It only showed up rarely, and under high load, but we felt it was important to clean it up immediately.

Turns out, our RPC channels were not cancel-safe. We made the appropriate adjustment to the [quic-rpc](https://crates.io/crates/quic-rpc) crate, which is a crate that we've written allowing many different RPC streaming options used in combination with a few different transports (including using QUIC streams or in memory channels). We then upgraded `quic-rpc` in iroh to fix the issue.

Check out [PR #2416](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/2416) on iroh and [PR #87](https://github.com/n0-computer/quic-rpc/pull/87) on quic-rpc for details.

### Custom Protocols

We’ve made it even easier to use iroh as the networking layer for your protocol! You can now add custom protocols when building an iroh `Node`, using the new `ProtocolBuilder`:

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use anyhow::Result;
use futures_lite::future::Boxed as BoxedFuture;
use iroh::{node::{Node, ProtocolHandler}, net::endpoint::Connecting, client::Iroh};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {

	const MY_ALPN: &[u8] = b"my-protocol/1";

	#[derive(Debug)]
	struct MyProtocol {
	   client: Iroh
	}

	impl ProtocolHandler for MyProtocol {
	   fn accept(self: Arc<Self>, conn: Connecting) -> BoxedFuture<Result<()>> {
	       todo!();
	   }
	}

	// Build an in-memory node
	let unspawned_node = Node::memory()
	   .build()
	   .await?;

	// Create a handle to that node in the form of a `Client`, so
	// that your protocol has access to the underlying store.
	let client = unspawned_node.client().clone();
	let handler = MyProtocol { client };

	// Add your custom ALPN and handler code and spawn the iroh `Node`
	let node = unspawned_node
	   .accept(MY_ALPN, Arc::new(handler))
	   .spawn()
	   .await?;
	node.shutdown().await?;
	Ok(())
}

```

Take a look at the [custom protocol](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/blob/main/iroh/examples/custom-protocol.rs) work for a more fleshed-out example.

Check out [PR #2358](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/2358) for details.

### Iroh without Docs

We’ve made the iroh `Node` more versatile! Let’s say you want to use iroh for networking and storage but don’t have a use case for iroh docs. We’ve made it dead simple to disable docs, so you can use the iroh `Node` for your exact purposes without worrying that you are dragging around pieces you don’t need.

Use `Builder::disable_docs()` when building the iroh `Node`; you’ll have just that. When called, the docs engine will not be spawned and the docs protocol will not be registered. Incoming docs connections will be dropped, and all docs-related RPC calls will return an error "docs are disabled".

Check out [PR #2390](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/2390) for details.

### Easier RPC connections

If you plan to run iroh in some unusual architecture, this is the release for you.

We’ve added APIs to help launch an iroh `Client` that communicates to an iroh `Node` in a different process. Using `Iroh::connect_addr`, you can build an iroh `Client` that makes RPC calls to a given `SocketAddr`. We’ve also added `Node::my_rpc_port` to allow the iroh `Node` to communicate what RPC port it is running on.

This, most notably, will help with running iroh in docker. Keep your eyes peeled for some news in the coming weeks…

Check out [PR #2398](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/2398) for details.

### Relay Server cleanup

The relay server got some much-needed love. Refactoring the code has allowed us to add the ability to run the relay behind a reverse proxy, disable captive portal responses, and run the server without TLS. The new configuration file has other options to allow for more customization, all of which are explained in the API Changes section below.

Check out [PR #2341](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/2341) for details.

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### Protocol Changes

None!

### API Changes

- `iroh`
    - Builder loses the `E` type parameter
    - ProtocolBuilder loses the `E` type parameter
    - rpc_endpoint takes a `boxed::ServerEndpoint`
    - renamed
        - `client::Iroh::connect` -> `client::Iroh::connect_path`
    - added
        - `client::Iroh::connect_addr`
        - `rpc_port` field to `client::NodeStatus`
- `iroh-net`
    - The configuration file format for the `relay` server has changed, deployments will need to updated. For the full format see `struct Config` in `iroh-net/src/bin/iroh-relay.rs`. Here a summary:
        - The 3 parts of the server now have an independent enable setting: `enable_relay`, `enable_stun` and `enable_metrics`. If omitted they default to `true`.
        - The way to specify which addresses the server listens on has changed: `http_bind_addr` is for the relay server, `stun_bind_addr` for the STUN server, `metrics_bind_addr` is for the optional metrics server and `tls.https_bind_addr` is for when TLS is enabled. Note these are now all full socket addresses. All have sensible defaults if omitted.
        - There are new options in `tls.cert_path` and `tls.key_path` which allow more control over where the manual TLS keys are to be read from.
    - removed
        - `iroh_net::config` is removed.
        - `iroh_net::config::NetInfo` -> removed
        - `iroh_net::config::LinkInfo` -> removed
        - `Endpoing::my_addr_with_endpoints` has been removed.
    - renamed
        - `Endpoint::local_endpoints` -> `Endpoint::direct_addresses`
        - `endpoint::LocalEndpointStream` -> `endpoint::DirectAddrStream`
        - `config::Endpoint` -> `magicsock::DirectAddr`
        - `config::EndpointType` -> `magicsock::DirectAddrType`
        - `Endpoint::local_addr` -> `Endpoint::bound_sockets`
        - `Endpoint::my_addr` -> `Endpoint::node_addr`
        - `Endpoint::my_relay` -> `Endpoint::home_relay`
        - `defaults::DEFAULT_RELAY_STUN_PORT` → `defaults::DEFAULT_STUN_PORT`
    - changed
        - `endpoint::Connecting::alpn` returns `Vec<u8>` instead of `String`
- `iroh-gossip`
    - `net::Gossip::update_endpoints` -> `net::Gossip::update_direct_addresses`

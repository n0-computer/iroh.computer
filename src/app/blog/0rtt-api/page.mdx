Despite all the complexity required to enable dial-by-node-id and direct connections, iroh has a very simple API. You create an endpoint, create connections, create streams, and then send data.

There is some complexity involved in properly [closing QUIC connections](https://www.iroh.computer/blog/closing-a-quic-connection), but
other than that, everything is pretty straightforward.

One aspect of iroh connections that is a bit more complex is 0-RTT. This blog post explains what 0-RTT is, when to use it, when **not** to use it, and will show a small example.

# What is 0-RTT

Iroh connections are just peer-to-peer QUIC connections, using a fork of the Quinn rust crate. QUIC uses TLS for encryption.

So to explain what 0-RTT is, it is helpful to explain how a normal TLS handshake works in detail.

<Note>
We refer to logical TLS messages as just messages. Messages can be split into multiple QUIC frames, and multiple QUIC frames will be combined in QUIC packets, which will then be sent over the network. But for the purpose of explaining the handshake these details don't matter.
</Note>

## Normal TLS handshake

<div className="not-prose">
  <img src="/blog/0rtt-api/1rtt.png" width={1200} height={754} alt="minimal 0rtt interaction" />
</div>

### ClientHello

The connection is initiated from the client by sending a `ClientHello`. This message contains the TLS protocol version, random data, and the set of supported cipher suites. In addition, iroh always includes a set of ALPN strings that identify the application-level protocols that the client wishes to speak.

When receiving the `ClientHello`, the server has information to narrow down the set of cryptographic primitives to use. The server endpoint also has a set of ALPNs it supports, so it can downselect those as well.

<Note>
If the intersection of the ALPNs requested by the client and the ALPNs supported by the server is empty, the handshake will nevertheless continue.

If the intersection of *cipher suites* between client and server is empty however, the handshake will *definitely* fail. The server will not send a `ServerHello`, but just a TLS alert indicating a handshake failure.
</Note>

### ServerHello

The `ServerHello` message contains a random value as well as a *single* cipher suite that is to be used for further communication. It also contains a *single* ALPN selected by the server to select the application level protocol for the rest of the session - or none if there was no overlap.

So in short, the purpose of the `ServerHello` is to downselect the cipher suite and ALPN, and to contribute randomness for the generation of a unique session specific symmetric key.

The server will send the `ServerHello`, possibly additional encrypted messages for connection setup, and then a `Finished` message.

### Session setup

Once the client has received the `ServerHello`, it has collected all the required information to set up the session for transporting user-data. At this point the cipher suite and ALPN are fixed for the rest of the session.

<Note>
In the case where there is no overlap between client and server ALPNs, in principle it is possible to fall back to a default ALPN, but this is not relevant for iroh connections.
</Note>

Since the cipher suite is now fixed, the client can now use the client and server random data to derive two symmetric keys, one for additional handshake messages and one for application data.

Every message that the client receives after the `ServerHello` is encrypted with the symmetric keys that are now shared knowledge on both sides.

The client processes possible additional packages from the server until it receives the `Finished` message. At that point it validates that it has received all setup messages from the server using a secure checksum contained in the server's `Finished` message.

### User-data

Now the client has ingested and validated all the messages relevant for connection setup, and has derived the keys required for user-data encryption. It can finally send a `Finished` message itself, finishing the handshake from its side.

Immediately after this, the client can send the first message of user-data, encrypted with the derived application keys.

After the server receives the `Finished` message from the client, it can forward user-data to the application space. Also at this time it will send a number of `NewSessionTicket` messages to the client that contains a pre-shared key for session resumption or 0-RTT in subsequent connections.

As you can see, the handshake is somewhat expensive in terms of computation, but more importantly, requires a roundtrip from client to server and back before the first bit of user-data can flow, even in the case where both sides have talked recently.

## 0-RTT handshake

In many cases, in particular for long lived connections, the overhead of the handshake is completely acceptable. But there are many protocols where there is just a very brief information exchange between a client and a server, and latency is critical. In these cases, it would be a big advantage for the client to optimistically send user-data immediately after the `ClientHello`.

For latency critical protocols, you simply get your answer faster. But even for non-latency critical protocols, the overhead is reduced because the total duration of the interaction is reduced, so there are fewer requests in flight.

0-RTT is only possible if a client has received pre-shared keys from the server via `NewSessionTicket` messages, which is the case if they performed a full handshake in the recent past.

<div className="not-prose">
  <img src="/blog/0rtt-api/0rtt-norenew.png" width={1200} height={754} alt="Normal TLS handshake" />
</div>

### ClientHello

Like before, the client sends a `ClientHello` message. The `ClientHello` for a connection attempt using 0-RTT must contain a set of ids of pre-shared keys, otherwise it is not possible for the server to decrypt subsequent user-data before the full handshake is complete. In addition it has an `early data` flag set.

Immediately after the `ClientHello`, the client will send a message containing user-data. Since a full exchange has not happened yet, the client has to choose one of the previously used PSKs for encryption, typically the most recent one.

### Server side

On the server side, the server receives the special `ClientHello`. In the happy case, it still has the key for the pre-shared key used by the client and will use it to decrypt subsequent messages. It will proceed with sending a `ServerHello` immediately, as before. This message will also have the `early data` flag set to indicate that the server might also send data before the handshake is complete.

Once the server receives the early user-data message, if it accepts 0-rtt requests, it will attempt to decrypt the message and forward it to the application space. The application space can then answer with an early data message on its own.

### Handshake completes

Regardless of early data in any direction, the normal handshake continues as before. Once the client receives a `Finished` message from the server, it will compute symmetric encryption keys as before and then switch to this set of keys for all subsequent messages. Likewise, once the server receives a `Finished` message from the client, it will compute keys and switch encryption.

### Replay attacks

By now we should have a pretty good idea what 0-RTT is and why it is useful. Being able to send user-data in the first UDP message seems tremendously useful. So why isn't it the default?

The client message uses a previously received pre-shared key for encryption. For as long as this PSK is valid on the server, you can just re-send the *exact same packet*, and the user-data will be sent to the application on the server side. This could be used to create unwanted changes on the server in case of a non-idempotent request, or to create a large load by sending the same request millions of times.

In addition, due to the fact that the process of computing the session keys from the PSK is - and has to be - fully deterministic, once an attacker has access to the key, they can decrypt all past or future 0-RTT data encrypted using that key. Since the session switches encryption after the handshake completes, data after handshake completion is not affected by this.

So in general you should only use 0-RTT for protocols where all requests are idempotent (so receiving the same message multiple times does not change the outcome) and where receiving and answering the message is not a lot of effort, so processing a message several times does not create a problem.

<Note>
You can make protocols idempotent by adding sequence numbers or random unique message ids in your application level protocol, at the expense of some server side state. The same approach can also be used to reduce the impact of receiving the same message multiple times.
</Note>

# Usage in iroh

Now let's implement a simple 0rtt service in iroh. It is going to be a simple echo service, where we just read a tiny request and echo it back byte for byte.

## Accept side

On the accept side, this is relatively easy. We do have to opt in to allowing 0rtt requests, since as we have seen 0rtt has reduced security guarantees compared to normal requests with a full handshake before the data starts to flow.

When we get a `Connecting` by calling `incoming.accept()?`, we try to convert it into a 0rtt connection using `.into_0rtt()`. This will always succeed on the server side, but we have to handle the error anyway because we use the same types on the server and client side. Once that is done, the code is identical to a non-0rtt echo service.

```rust
let connecting = incoming.accept()?;
let connection = connecting.into_0rtt().expect("accept into 0.5 RTT always succeeds").0;
let (mut send, mut recv) = connection.accept_bi().await?;
let data = recv.read_to_end(8).await?;
send.write_all(&data).await?;
send.finish()?;
connection.closed().await;
```

## Connect side

The connect side is more tricky, because we need to deal with the case where we can't *initiate* a 0rtt connection because we don't have tickets from a previous connection, as well as the case where the remote side does not *accept* a 0rtt connection, e.g. because it no longer has the corresponding secret.

We first define a helper fn for the entire ping protocol:
```rust
async fn pingpong(
    connection: &Connection,
    proceed: impl Future<Output = bool>,
    x: u64,
) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let (mut send, mut recv) = connection.open_bi().await?;
    let data = x.to_be_bytes();
    send.write_all(&data).await?;
    send.finish()?;
    let recv = if proceed.await {
        // use recv directly if we can proceed
        recv
    } else {
        // proceed returned false, so we have learned that the 0-RTT send was rejected.
        // at this point we have a fully handshaked connection, so we try again.
        let (mut send, mut recv) = connection.open_bi().await?;
        send.write_all(&data).await?;
        send.finish()?;
        recv
    };
    let echo = recv.read_to_end(8).await?;
    anyhow::ensure!(echo == data);
    Ok(())
}
```

It creates a bidi stream, and immediately sends the payload to the other side. If the proceed future returns true, it tries to read the result from the initial recv stream, otherwise it starts with a new bidi stream. Once it has read the echo result, it ensures that it is identical to what was sent.

Other than the proceed future, this is exactly as you would write this without 0rtt.

Now the function that actually tries to send a 0rtt request:

```rust
async fn pingpong_0rtt(connecting: Connecting, i: u64) -> anyhow::Result<Connection> {
    let connection = match connecting.into_0rtt() {
        Ok((connection, accepted)) => {
            trace!("0-RTT possible from our side");
            pingpong(&connection, accepted, i).await?;
            connection
        }
        Err(connecting) => {
            trace!("0-RTT not possible from our side");
            let connection = connecting.await?;
            pingpong(&connection, future::ready(true), i).await?;
            connection
        }
    };
    Ok(connection)
}
```

As on the accept side, we try to convert the `Connecting` into a 0rtt connection using `.into_0rtt()`.

If this succeeds, we get back a preliminary connection and a future that resolves once the full handshake is complete. We pass that future into the fn defined above.

If it fails, we just call the above fn with a dummy future that immediately succeeds, since in this case we only get the connection after a full handshake.

# Trying it out

We can of course try this out locally, but that won't show a big difference between both versions, since the latency on localhost is extremely low.

So we run the accept part on a machine that is far away. In this case we are running the accept part on a machine in Asia, and the connect part on my local machine in Europe.

Just for reference, here is the current ping to this machine:

```
â¯ ping 5.223.43.41
PING 5.223.43.41 (5.223.43.41): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 5.223.43.41: icmp_seq=0 ttl=51 time=354.038 ms
64 bytes from 5.223.43.41: icmp_seq=1 ttl=51 time=235.610 ms
64 bytes from 5.223.43.41: icmp_seq=2 ttl=51 time=290.190 ms
64 bytes from 5.223.43.41: icmp_seq=3 ttl=51 time=308.652 ms
```

So, on the order of `250 ms`. The whole point of a 0-RTT request is to get data back in the first roundtrip, so we expect a similar value for the send to receive delay.

## Accept side

Running the accept side prints a ticket that we need to connect. We want this to be a pure test of 0rtt latency, not node discovery latency. So in the code we have disabled node resolution and made sure that the ticket contains the direct address of the node. This also means that the accept side must be running on machine with a public IP address.

```
Listening on: NodeAddr { node_id: PublicKey(e7c3b8c21ad4393c1d21c2ca05c5e9fdb6492aa2f077ae776a6fe6d0c5ff3dd7), relay_url: None, direct_addresses: {5.223.43.41:34981, [2a01:4ff:2f0:14d4::1]:34982} }

```

## Connect side

On the connect side, we just need to specify the node ticket to connect to and optionally the number of rounds.

```

2025-05-27T11:13:12.539167Z TRACE 0rtt: 0-RTT possible from our side
```

Now this is weird.

The initial connection is not 0-RTT, which is expected. The two nodes haven't ever talked, so there is no pre-shared secret they can use to communicate.

The next two rounds are 0-RTT, as expected, and have roughly the expected roundtrip times.

But then we get a non 0-RTT connection on the 4th round. What's going on?

The issue is that 0-RTT is done using *single-use* tickets. *After* each completed handshake, you get a number of these tickets, by default 2. And as soon as the tickets are used up, the client can not even *attempt* to do a 0-rtt request because it has run out of tickets to use.

In the code so far we close the connection immediately after receiving the user-data response. So we don't wait for the full handshake to complete, and also don't get any additional tickets.

```rust
pingpong_0rtt(connecting, i).await?
connection.close(0u8.into(), b"");
```

There are three ways to solve this.

## Waiting for new tickets

The tickets for 0-RTT connections are single use in Quinn, as recommended in the TLS spec: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446#appendix-C.4 . We can get new tickets via a connection that was initiated with 0-RTT, but only if we allow time for the handshake to complete.

There is currently no API to wait for the handshake to complete or to wait for session tickets. But we can just sleep for two times the current round trip time before closing the connection. This is a crude way to allow for enough time for the two `NewSessionTicket`s to be received.

Since we don't want to hold up the user-space just because we are waiting for an additional message, we do this in a tokio task.

```rust
tokio::spawn(async move {
  tokio::time::sleep(connection.rtt() * 2).await;
  connection.close(0u8.into(), b"");
})
```

In the future we would want to replace the crude sleep with a more precise API that waits exactly until at least one NewSessionTicket message has been received.

<div className="not-prose">
  <img src="/blog/0rtt-api/0rtt-renew.png" width={1200} height={754} alt="0rtt communication with ticket renewal" />
</div>

## Sending more tickets

Another possible solution would be to just reconfigure the server to send more session tickets. E.g. you could send 8 instead of 2. The downside of this is that you send additional data, but the upside is that you get more 0-RTT connections per full handshake. Alas, this is currently not configurable without having to modify iroh.

## Reusing tickets

The TLS spec says that you *SHOULD NOT* reuse tickets - you should treat them as single use on the client side. But *SHOULD NOT* just *discourages* this, but does not outright forbid it. And due to its stateless nature the server side will not reject multiple 0-RTT connection attempts using the same ticket.

So in theory you could modify the client to reuse the ticket. This is nothing we currently do in iroh. It is just a hypothetical option if you can't afford the wait for the new session ticket.

## So what to do?

Let's take a step back and think about when you would use 0-RTT. If you have two nodes that communicate frequently every few seconds or even minutes, it is probably best to just leave the connection open. A normal QUIC connection has very low overhead, and even for a hole-punched iroh QUIC connection the overhead of occasional messages to keep the connection open is very acceptable.

So you would use 0-RTT if communication is in small bursts spaced many minutes to hours apart, but nevertheless latency is important. In this case, the most important property of 0-RTT is that the application gets a response after the minimal physically possible delay. Keeping the connection open for another small time period to refresh the pre-shared keys is not a big deal.

So this is the option we ended up implementing. Here is the output after this modification. We now get a 0-rtt connection every time.

# Wireshark

You can of course just take the content of this blog post and use it. But if you want to know exactly what is going on on the wire, here is how you would do it (I write this partly as future reference for myself).

To see the handshake packets in all detail, you need a package capture tool like [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/). If you run this example with a remote node, it is pretty easy to configure a filter that captures just the traffic of the example.

When wireshark starts up you choose the network interface that will be used for communication, e.g. `WiFi: en0` for the wireless connection on a mac. This is the network interface used to communicate with the outside world.

Next you want to select only UDP traffic to the destination IP address where the accept side runs. So you end up with a filter rule like this:

```
udp and host 5.223.43.41
```

This is sufficient, since there is no other traffic going to that host.

Now run the program with a small number of rounds and see what is being captured.

<div className="not-prose">
  <img src="/blog/0rtt-api/wireshark-encrypted.png" width={1200} height={754} alt="Encrypted packages" />
</div>

This is already quite interesting. Unfortunately there is a lot you can learn about traffic content by just looking at packet size and timing. But to really understand what is going on we would of course have to look into the packets, and this is not possible for all but the initial packets due to encryption.

Fortunately iroh has a feature to persist the required information for decrypting the packet content. In the endpoint builder you can specify `.keylog(true)`. This will check for an environment variable `SSLKEYLOGFILE`, and if it exists, write all information required for decryption into that file.

```rust
let endpoint = iroh::Endpoint::builder()
    .keylog(true)
    .bind()
    .await?;
```

Now we just need to run the connect side again with SSLKEYLOGFILE set, e.g.

```
SSLKEYLOGFILE=keylog.txt RUST_LOG=0rtt=debug cargo run --release --example 0rtt --rounds 10 nodeab...
```

After running this, `keylog.txt` will contain all the secrets required to decode the captured packages. You don't have to fully understand what is in there, the main thing is that wireshark *does* understand it.

...
```

But really, there is no deep magic going on here. These are just the secrets that are being exchanged in ClientHello and ServerHello during the handshake.

Once we tell wireshark to use the keylog file, we can inspect the decrypted packet content and can also see a bit more information in the text view:

Explaining the packet content would be a blog post of its own. But we can now drill down to an individual packet, look at the decrypted content, and find our big endian encoded ping sequence number.

The code for this blog post is an [example](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/blob/main/iroh/examples/0rtt.rs) in the iroh repo.

Note that it is using current main, which is undergoing some API changes due to our [effort](https://www.iroh.computer/blog/iroh-0-35-prepping-for-1-0) to get out iroh 1.0 this summer.

To try this out, run the example on two machines that have a high latency connection, to see the effect of 0-rtt connections. You will have to enable the `examples` feature, and you should probably run in release mode.

So this is the full command line for the accept side:

```
cargo run --release --features=examples --example 0rtt
```

For the connect side, you have to provide the ticket produced by the accept side.

```
cargo run --release --features=examples --example 0rtt TICKET
```

You can also connect to our test node that should be far away from most readers of this blog post:

```
cargo run --release --features examples --example 0rtt nodeadt4hogcdlkdspa5ehbmubof5h63msjkulyhpltxnjx6nugf7465oaacaac56kzjrtxaeajkaecp6axqctkaaaaaaaaaaaabrxxae
```

You can disable 0-rtt using the `--disable-0rtt` arg. Since the node above is far away, you should see a noticeable difference.

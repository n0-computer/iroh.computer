Welcome to a new release of iroh, a library for building on direct connections between devices, putting more control in the hands of your users.

We're excited to announce that the iroh crate has been streamlined, fulfilling the goal we outlined in our blog post, [*"Smaller is Better."*](/blog/smaller-is-better) Iroh is now leaner and more focused, serving as a core library for building direct connections between devices.

The protocols we've developed on top of iroh have been split into their own dedicated crates for [iroh-blobs](/proto/iroh-blobs), [iroh-docs](/proto/iroh-docs), and [iroh-gossip](/proto/iroh-gossip), respectively.

Additionally, iroh is no longer a CLI. We've also updated our terminology to better reflect its purpose: what we previously referred to as the iroh "Node" is now called the iroh "Router"—a more accurate name for its role in stacking protocols on top of iroh's peer-to-peer connections. All terminology is updated on our [docs site](/docs) to reflect these changes.


## ♻️ Upgrade Guide

With a smaller iroh, you get way more flexibility. You can still recreate the setups that were once required-bundled into iroh, and this blog will guide you through upgrading your code! We've swept out a bunch of code from the main iroh codebase. Here is an upgrade guide to the biggest changes in this new release, you can find a full list of breaking changes [below](#breaking-changes).

### `iroh-net` is now just `iroh`

This is a pretty straightforward migration that’s more spiritual than a change in functionality. If your code depends on `iroh-net`, change that dependency to `iroh@v0.29.0`, and change any instance where you import from `iroh_net` to `iroh`.

### Protocol Registry

We now have a short list of the protocols we've factored out of iroh at [https://iroh.computer/proto](https://iroh.computer/registry). We've moved blobs, docs, and gossip here, while also making room for some new protocols in the works from the number 0 team & others!

### No more `Node` in iroh

Iroh previously provided you with a Node that came bundled with the `iroh-docs`, `iroh-blobs`, and `iroh-gossip` protocols enabled. This also meant that iroh was not only a networking library, but also responsible for storage for these different protocols. Now, we've shifted our thinking. The iroh library provides you with an endpoint, a light framework for implementing your own protocols, and a router that combines that endpoint and those protocols (as well as the n0-developed protocols).

That means we have no more `Node` in iroh. If you rely on the node, we've added migration instructions for how to get the n0-developed protocols into iroh, as well as custom protocols that you have developed yourself.

### `iroh::Endpoint`

No matter what protocol(s) you use, you will start with building an `iroh::Endpoint`. This is what creates, drives, and hole-punches the connections that undergird the protocols.

Note that, by default, the `endpoint::Builder` will bind to `0.0.0.0:0` and disable discovery, so please check out [the build options](https://docs.rs/iroh/latest/iroh/endpoint/struct.Builder.html) for more in-depth ways to configure the endpoint.

If you are converting straight from a default `iroh::Node`, make sure to include the `Builder::discovery_n0` option, which will enable the discovery mechanisms it had on by default.

```rust
use iroh::Endpoint;
use anyhow::Result;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
	let endpoint = Endpoint::builder().discovery_n0().bind().await?
	println!("my node id: {}", endpoint.node_id());
	Ok(())
}
```

### `iroh-blobs`

Two important parts are needed when building a `Blobs` protocol handler to use with the `Router`: a local pool and a store.

The local pool manages all tasks spawned when working with `iroh-blobs`. It makes sure they are completed and closed once dropped. When building a the `Blobs` handler (or if you also need to build a `Downloader` or the `iroh-docs` protocol), you will pass a handle to the `LocalPool`. Make sure you don’t accidentally drop the local pool early, as that will close all the tasks before you mean to.

The store is where the blobs are kept, this can be loaded from a file or be an in-memory store.

```rust
use anyhow::Result;
use iroh::{protocol::Router, Endpoint};
use iroh_blobs::{net_protocol::Blobs, util::local_pool::LocalPool};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // create an iroh endpoint that includes the standard discovery mechanisms
    // we've built at number0
    let endpoint = Endpoint::builder().discovery_n0().bind().await?;
    println!("my node id: {}", endpoint.node_id());
    // spawns a local pool with one thread per CPU
    // for a single threaded pool use `LocalPool::single`
    let local_pool = LocalPool::default();

    // create an in-memory blob store
    // use `iroh_blobs::net_protocol::Blobs::persistent` to load or create a
    // persistent blob store from a path
    let blobs = Blobs::memory().build(local_pool.handle(), &endpoint);

    // turn on the "rpc" feature if you need to create blobs and tags clients
    let blobs_client = blobs.clone().client();
    let tags_client = blobs_client.tags();

    // build the router
    let router = Router::builder(endpoint)
        .accept(iroh_blobs::ALPN, blobs)
        .spawn();

    // make sure not to drop the local_pool before you are finished
    Ok(())
}
```

### `iroh-gossip`

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;

use anyhow::Result;
use iroh::{protocol::Router, Endpoint};
use iroh_gossip::{net::Gossip, proto::Config};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // create an iroh endpoint that includes the standard discovery mechanisms
    // we've built at number0
    let endpoint = Endpoint::builder().discovery_n0().bind().await?;
    println!("my node id: {}", endpoint.node_id());

    // get your address
    let node_addr = endpoint.node_addr().await?;
    let addr_info = node_addr.info;

    // look at `iroh_gossip::proto::topic::Config`
    // for more configuration details.
    let config = Config::default();

    // create gossip
    let gossip = Arc::new(Gossip::from_endpoint(endpoint.clone(), config, &addr_info));

    // turn on the "rpc" feature to use the gossip client
    let gossip_client = gossip.client();

    // create router and add gossip protocol
    let router = Router::builder(endpoint)
        .accept(iroh_gossip::ALPN, gossip)
        .spawn().await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

### `iroh-docs`

Setting up the docs protocol is a funny little beast. It’s a “meta protocol” that includes both the `iroh-blobs` and `iroh-gossip` protocols and so requires some involved set up.


```rust
use std::{path::PathBuf, sync::Arc};

use anyhow::Result;
use iroh::{Endpoint, protocol::Router};
use iroh_blobs::{
    downloader::Downloader, net_protocol::Blobs, util::local_pool::LocalPool,
};
use iroh_docs::engine::Engine as Docs;
use iroh_gossip::net::Gossip;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // local thread pool manager for blobs and docs
    let local_pool = LocalPool::default();

    // create endpoint
    let endpoint = Endpoint::builder()
        .discovery_n0()
        .bind()
        .await?;

    // build the protocol router
    let mut builder = Router::builder(endpoint);

    // add iroh-gossip
    let addr = builder.endpoint().node_addr().await?;
    let gossip = Gossip::from_endpoint(
        builder.endpoint().clone(),
        Default::default(),
        &addr.info,
    );
    builder = builder.accept(iroh_gossip::ALPN, Arc::new(gossip.clone()));

    // add iroh-blobs
    let blobs = Blobs::memory().build(local_pool.handle(), builder.endpoint())?;
    builder = builder.accept(iroh_blobs::ALPN, blobs.clone());

    // add iroh-docs

    // setup docs storage
    let docs_store = iroh_docs::store::Store::memory();
    let author_store = iroh_docs::engine::DefaultAuthorStorage::Memory;

    let docs = Arc::new(Docs::spawn(
        builder.endpoint().clone(),
        gossip,
        docs_store,
        blobs.store().clone(),
        blobs.downloader().clone(),
        author_store,
        local_pool.handle().clone(),
    )
    .await?);
    builder = builder.accept(iroh_docs::ALPN, docs.clone());

    // spawn the router
    let router = builder.spawn().await?;

    // enable the `rpc` feature to get the memory rpc client
    let docs_client = docs.client().clone();
    let authors_client = docs_client.authors();

    Ok(())
}
```

### Your very own protocol

It’s straightforward to add your own protocol to the iroh `Router`.

```rust
use iroh::{Endpoint, protocols::Router};

mod cool_protocol {
    /// The ALPN
    pub const ALPN: &[u8] = b"/my/cool/protocol/1";

    pub struct Protocol;

    /// Implement ProtocolHandler
    impl iroh::protocol::ProtocolHandler {
        /// Needs to at least implement the `accept` function
        fn accept(self: Arc<Self>, conn: iroh::endpoint::Connecting) -> BoxedFuture<anyhow::Result<()>> {
            Box::pin(async move {
                // Here you implement what your protocol does when a new connection is attempted
                println!("got a new incoming connection);
            })
        }
    }
}

// create your protocol
let my_cool_protocol = Arc::new(cool_protocol::Protocol::new());

// build an endpoint
let endpoint = Endpoint::builder()
    .discovery_n0()
    .bind()
    .await?;

// build a router that connects the endpoint to the protocol
let router = Router::builder(endpoint)
    .accept(cool_protocol::ALPN, my_cool_protocol.clone())
    .spawn()
    .await?;

// from here, you can use iroh.endpoint().connect() to connect via a NodeId
// or use your protocol to handle incoming connections
```

For a full example of a custom protocol take a look at the [`echo` protocol](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/blob/main/iroh/examples/echo.rs).


If you are looking for examples of how to create an RPC client for your protocol using [quic-rpc](https://docs.rs/quic-rpc), take a look at the [iroh-gossip repo](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-gossip/tree/main/src/rpc) for a simple example and the [iroh-blobs repo](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-gossip/tree/main/src/rpc) for a more complex one that includes streaming rpc (server side & bidirectional).


And that’s it! Full list of breaking changes follows. This is a big release the n0 team has been working toward on our road to 1.0, and can’t wait for you to try it out!

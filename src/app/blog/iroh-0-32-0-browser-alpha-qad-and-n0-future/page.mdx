Welcome to a new release of `iroh`, a p2p library that just works, putting more control in the hands of your users. This release brings you some cool new features that we can't wait to get into your dependency tree.

To start: join us in testing out `iroh` that compiles to WASM and can work in the browser! Next, `iroh` can work in higher latency environments with larger packet loss due to QUIC address discovery. Finally, take a look at the `n0-future` crate for a single, sane, curated crate for working with a smattering of `futures-*` crates, as well `tokio::{spawn,task,time}` alternatives that can compile to WASM.

## üñ•Ô∏è¬†iroh in the browser alpha release!

We've got preliminary iroh support for browsers via WebAssembly!
During this preliminary support phase, you'll need to depend on a branch to be able to use it, but we'll release it properly soon.

To try it out, add this git dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
iroh = { git = "https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh.git", branch = "matheus23/iroh-browser", default-features = false }
```

Running `cargo build --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown` should *just work,* if the rest of your project can also build to Wasm.

Some caveats:

- WebAssembly support won't be compatible with any additional iroh features. Namely `metrics`, `test-utils`, `discovery-local-network`, nor `discovery-pkarr-dht`.
- Browser support specifically needs [`wasm-bindgen`](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/)'s bindings generation, so that needs to be set up. We also leverage [`wasm-bindgen-futures`](https://docs.rs/wasm-bindgen-futures), so async iroh code will use javascript promises on the main browser thread. So if you‚Äôre spawning tasks that should run iroh functions, make sure to use `wasm-bindgen-futures`.
- Using iroh from browsers will be similar to using iroh in a "relay only" mode. When you connect to another node, the traffic *will* be end-to-end encrypted for the node you connect to in particular, however, it won't try to hole-punch or try to establish a direct connection, as that's not possible in browsers without deeply integrating with WebRTC. Instead, traffic is relayed via a WebSocket connections to relays.

Remember, this is specifically support for iroh *in browsers*, which we expect to be the biggest use case for compiling iroh to WebAssembly. We don't support other related things such as running `wasm32-unknown-unknown` Wasm files without `wasm-bindgen` nor compiling to `wasm32-wasi` or similar.

## üåç¬†Quic Address Discovery (QAD) on the iroh-relays

Finding out your node‚Äôs public address is one of the big steps necessary for hole-punching. Without knowing your public IP address, you have no way to let anyone else know what it is either. It‚Äôd be like wanting a friend to mail you a package, but not being able to tell them what your address is. We use a few different protocols speak to the `iroh` relay servers to learn about your public IP address (and a few other pieces of information).

Previously, we relied solely on protocols that communicated over UDP. UDP is great when you want to fire and forget, but if you need reliability or the ability to retransmit data, to ensure the other side of the connection definitely received the data, you can‚Äôt rely on UDP.

In high latency, noisy areas across the world, where traffic and packet loss might get too overwhelming for UDP, **we were unable to always relay on STUN and ICMP**. One solution we had to deal with the quirks of UDP, was to ensure we had relays all over the world, so that a user‚Äôs node has a better chance of reaching and getting a response from a relay server.

The other way we could solve this was by using a protocol for learning your public IP address, that was based on a reliable transport. QUIC is already an enormous part of our codebase, we thought we could use QUIC to solve this problem for us.

We implemented the [Quic Address Discovery RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-seemann-quic-address-discovery/) to do just that.

Now, in `iroh-net-report`, we race STUN and QUIC address discovery probes to see which will get us our public IP address as soon as possible.

Our relays are all equipped with a QUIC endpoint that has QUIC Address Discovery enabled. Now, in our worst case scenario, very high latency and packet loss may result in a probe that takes a bit to respond, but this change takes us from no response at all to a response that is just delayed.

## üí´¬†n0-future

Another `future` crate?! Aren‚Äôt there enough of them?

First, none of them have as a dramatic name as our new crate: `n0-future` üòé.

Second, this crate acts as a single place where we expose the most useful `futures-*` and tokio traits and structs that work well with `iroh`, and that, in our experience, have the fewest ‚Äúfootguns‚Äù. **If you want to have the same codebase compile to Wasm and native simultaneously, `n0-future` is for you.**

Third, this does the major lift of co-locating a large amount of code that is very common in async programming, but does not work in the browser. `n0-future` takes care of the ugly `cfg`s for you. But with that said you should **not** need to import `n0-future` yourself if you are using `iroh` as a dependency. `n0-future` is an implementation detail of `iroh`, unless you start running into async headaches, especially if you're targeting WASM.

The major goal here is to make our (and your) coding lives easier. Rather than having to import multiple crates that all cover slightly different `futures`-like topics or stress about what can and cannot compile to WASM, just  import `n0-future` and be good to go.

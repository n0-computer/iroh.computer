Welcome to a new release of iroh, the open-source distributed systems toolkit with tools for connecting devices directly, moving data, and syncing state.

## üèë From fields to methods

After feedback from the community, we have decided to change how you access the subsystems on the `iroh::client::Client` through methods instead of fields. This allows for better discoverability and a more efficient implementation under the hood in the future. 

The old fields are deprecated and will be removed in the next release.

```rust
// iroh@0.17
let my_blob = iroh.blobs.read_to_bytes(my_hash).await?;

// iroh@0.18
let my_blob = iroh.blobs().read_to_bytes(my_hash).await?;
```

Checkout [PR #2350](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/2350) for details.

## üêò Gossip larger messages

`iroh-gossip` previously had a maximum message size of `4KiB`. We still used this default when using `iroh-gossip` inside the iroh client, but it can now be overridden when configuring the gossip client directly.

Checkout [PR #2340](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/pull/2340) for details.

## üöÄ Netcheck, but faster

Thanks to a new contributor and user of iroh, [**zh522130**](https://github.com/zh522130), the time to run netcheck in `iroh-net` is much shorter now, and it avoids blocking other operations. There‚Äôs only good news here: things work faster and more reliably.

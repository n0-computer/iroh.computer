Welcome to the first iroh release that **allows you to dial by just a Node ID**:

Thanks to great work from @frando @rklaehn and @arnazeh we now have an `iroh-dns-server` that allows for looking up node information via DNS, based on the pkarr format.

```bash
iroh blob get \ # download a blob
  --start     \ # start an iroh node while running this command
  --node p4augy7yocvwytsp4ygiayhqfygw7zpzudrg5otzk5ry5hl5ydya \ # the node id
  z5p3t7v2s3w5uifsyndr5wolx4fufdlktzoae76uqzwheqkfqdvairoh      # the hash of the blob
```

By default, iroh will connect to the DNS server run by number 0, but (as with our relays) you can configure iroh to use your own instance of `iroh-dns-server`.

## üèéÔ∏è Faster relay handshakes

To speed up connections to our relay servers, we have refactored the connection handshake. This drops a **full** roundtrip, on every new connection. This reduces the time to connect to the relays, in general, but dramatically speeds up connections to farther-away relays.

Unfortunately, this means the new relays can not talk to `0.13.0` nodes. To smooth out the upgrade path, we will keep the old relays running for at least another 4 weeks.

The new relays are available under these DNS entries. Please ensure any custom iroh config files you use are updated appropriately.

- US: `use1-1.relay.iroh.network`
- EU: `euw1-1.relay.iroh.network`

## ‚úçÔ∏è¬†Basic Author API

Authors are an important part of how documents are managed in iroh. We have finally provided an API to manage them!

```rust
// Setup an in-memory iroh node.
let node = Node::memory().spawn().await?;

// Create a new author.
let author_id = node.authors.create().await?;

let authors_stream = node.authors.list().await?;
// List of current authors, which is currently just the one we created above.
let authors: Vec<_> = authors_stream.try_collect().await?;

// Export the author for external usage.
let author = node.authors.export(author_id).await?.unwrap();

// I didn't like the author, let's delete it.
node.authors.delete(author_id).await?;

// Ah wait I still need it, import it again.
node.authors.import(author).await?;
```

## Upgrade redb to v2.0

Iroh relies on redb, both for storing data in `iroh-bytes` and storing document structure in `iroh-sync`. With the release of [redb@2.0](https://github.com/cberner/redb/releases/tag/v2.0.0) we gained a nice performance boost, and smaller features under the hood, allowing us to simplify the code in our storage implementations.

For more details checkout: Update redb to v2 ([#2120](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/issues/2120))

## But wait there‚Äôs more!

Many bugs were squashed and smaller features added. For all those details you can checkout the full changelog: https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/releases/tag/v0.14.0.

If you want to know what is coming up, checkout the `[0.15.0` milestone](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/milestone/21), and if you have any wishes let us know in the [issues](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/issues)!

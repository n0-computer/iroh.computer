The docs theme is based on the [protocol](https://protocol.tailwindui.com) tailwind theme, with a bunch of modifications. Protocol is a [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com) site template built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). 

## Getting started

You'll need [`node`](https://nodejs.org/) to run locally. To get started with this template, first install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

## Editing docs content
Our docs are generated. Use the following steps to make adjustments to the content and update the website to match:

- make your edits to the documentation in the `api-code-examples/api.mjs` file
- cd into the `scripts` folder
- run `npm install` if you have not run it in this folder previously
- run `node generate-api-pages.js` to generate the doc files for the website

### Style / grammar guide
Follow the style that has already been laid out. But as a general rule of thumb, follow normal English punctuation, but favor brevity over proper grammar. In other words, use capital letters at the start of sentences, and end them with a period, but sentences can be fragments if that gets the point across quicker.
